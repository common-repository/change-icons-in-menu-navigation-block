This plugin allows you to change the open and close menu icons in the WordPress navigation block with custom SVG icons.

== Description ==

The "Change Icons in Menu Navigation Block" plugin provides an easy and intuitive way to replace the default open and close menu icons in the WordPress navigation block. With this plugin, you can paste your custom SVG code for the icons directly into the WordPress admin area, offering a seamless way to customize your siteâ€™s appearance.

Icon that appears in plugin assets is created by Athok from Noun Project.

== How to use ==

1. Use the Settings->Change Menu Icons screen to configure the plugin.
2. Paste the SVG code for Open Icon and/or Close Icon. Note: Leave textarea in blank to keep the default icon.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use any SVG code for the icons? =

Yes, you can use any custom SVG code. However, please ensure that the SVG is properly sanitized to avoid security risks. I hardly recommend the noun project library and its search by "menu" https://thenounproject.com/search/icons/?q=menu

= Will this plugin work with any theme? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to work with any theme that uses the WordPress Navigation Block.
